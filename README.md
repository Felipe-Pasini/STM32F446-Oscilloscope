# STM32F446-Oscilloscope

Basic STM32F446 oscilloscope application, integrated with PC.

Doesn't need any external hardware or software, just a STM32 board and a computer.
Data acquired is exhibited in the PC via bitmap and, therefore, is not at real-time. 
It can still be really useful in situations where you have very limited resources, though
